## Description
`scrape` provides a self-contained low-to-no-setup tool to grab metadata and text content from web pages. The server provides a REST API to scrape web metadata, with support for batches, using either a direct client, with headless browser option that's useful for pages that need javascript to load. 

 Results are stored, so subsequent fetches of a particular URL are fast. Install the binary, and operate it as a shell command or as a server with a REST API. The default SQLite storage backend is performance-optimized and can store to disk or in memory. MySQL is also supported. Resources are stored with a configurable TTL. 

 The `scrape` cli tool provides shell access to scraped content via command-line entry or CSV files, and also provides database management functionality. `scrape-server` provides web and API access to content metadata in one-offs or batches.

 RSS and Atom feeds are supported via an endpoint in `scrape-server`. Loading a feed returns the parsed results for all item links in the feed. 

 Authorization via JWT keys is supported with a configuration option. The companion `scrape-jwt-encode` tool can be used to generate tokens, and to make the secret you need 
 to securely  sign and verify JWT tokens. 

 The `scrape` and `scrape-server` binaries should be buildable and runnable in any environment where `go` and `SQLite3` (or a `MySQL` server) are present. A docker build is also included. See `make help` for build instructions.

## Output Format
JSON output is a superset of Trafilatura fields. Empty fields may be omitted in responses.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----  | ---- | ------------|
| `url` | String (URL) | The (canonical) URL for the page, as reported by the page itself. If the page doesn't supply that, this field will contain  the same value as RequestedURL |
| `requested_url` | String (URL) | The URL that was actually requested. (Some URL params (e.g. utm_*) may be stripped before the outbound request) |
| `original_url` | String (URL) | Exactly the url that was in the inbound request |
| `fetch_time` | ISO8601 | The time that URL was retrieved |
| `fetch_method` | String | The type of client used to fetch this resource (`DefaultClient` or `HeadlessBrowser`)
| `status_code` | Int | The status code returned by the target server when fetching this page |
| `error` | String | Error message(s), if there were any, while processing this page |
| `hostname` | Domain name | The domain serving this resource |
| `date` | ISO8601 | The publish date of the page, in UTC time |
| `sitename` | String | Identifies the publisher. Can be domain, company name, or other text, IRL usage not consistent |
| `title` | String | The page's title | 
| `authors` | []String | Authors |
| `description` | String | Page summary or excerpt |
| `categories` | []String | Content categories, if supplied |
| `tags` | []String | Tags, if supplied |
| `language` | String | 2-letter language code |
| `page_type` | String | If it's there it's usually "article" following the `og`` usage |
| `image` | String (URL) | Hero image link |
| `license` | String | Generally empty |
| `content_text` | String | The text of the page, with all HTML removed |

Parsed field content is largely dependent on metadata included in the page. GIGO/YMMV.

Here's an example, with long fields truncated:

## Usage as a CLI Application
### Installing for shell usage
```
go install github.com/efixler/scrape/cmd/scrape@latest
```
The `scrape` command provides single and batch retrieval, using or bypassing the connected storage db. It also provides commands to manage the backing store.

### Quickstart
```
> scrape http://www.foo.com/some/url/path
```
That's actually it. The database will be created if it doesn't exist already.

```
scrape % ./scrape -h
Usage: 
	scrape [flags] :url [...urls]

In addition to http[s] URLs, file:/// urls are supported, using the current working directory as the base path.

Flags:
 
  -h	
  	Show this help message
  -clear
    	Clear the database and exit
  -csv value
    	CSV file path
  -csv-column value
    	The index of the column in the CSV that contains the URLs
    	Environment: SCRAPE_CSV_COLUMN (default 1)
  -database value
    	Database type:path
    	Environment: SCRAPE_DB (default sqlite:scrape_data/scrape.db)
  -db-password value
    	Database password
    	Environment: SCRAPE_DB_PASSWORD
  -db-user value
    	Database user
    	Environment: SCRAPE_DB_USER
  -headless
    	Use headless browser for extraction
  -log-level value
    	Set the log level [debug|error|info|warn]
    	Environment: SCRAPE_LOG_LEVEL (default WARN)
  -maintain
    	Execute database maintenance and exit
  -migrate value
    	Issue a db migration command: up, reset, or status
  -notext
    	Skip text content
    	Environment: SCRAPE_NOTEXT
  -ping
    	Ping the database and exit
  -user-agent value
    	User agent to use for fetching
    	Environment: SCRAPE_USER_AGENT (default Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:88.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/88.0)

```
#### Managing database migrations

The `-migrate` flag can be used to create (or update) the database. SQLite databases will be automatically brought up to date whenever `scrape` or `scrape-server` are invoked; MySQL
databases need to be explicitly migrated.

There are 3 accepted arguments to the `-migrate` flag:
- `up`: Bring the database up to the latest version, creating if necessary.
- `reset`: Bring the database down to no-tables and clear all data. The empty schema and permissions are preserved.
- `status`: Show the current migration version and state.


## Usage as a Server
The server provides a REST API to get resource data one-at-a-time or in bulk. The root URL serves up a page that can be used to spot check results for any url.

Running `scrape-server` with no arguments will bring up a server on port 8080 with a SQLite database, storing scraped pages for 30 days and without any authorization controls. See below for guidance on how to change these settings.

### Installation
```
go install github.com/efixler/scrape/cmd/scrape-server@latest
```
```
scrape % ./build/scrape-server -h

Usage:
-----
scrape-server [-port nnnn] [-h]

Some options have environment variable equivalents. Invalid environment settings
are ignored. Command line options override environment variables.

If environment variables are set, they'll override the defaults displayed in this

```

### Web Interface

The root path of the server (`/`) is browsable and provides a simple way to test URLs and results.

![Alt text](internal/server/admin/htdocs/assets/test-console-with-token.png)

The select on the left lets you select between loading results for a page url or for a feed, or scraping a page using the headless browser instead of a direct http client.

Token entry is shown here when the server is running with token authorization. For instructions on setting up authorization, [see below](#authorization)

### API 

#### batch [POST]
Returns the metadata for the supplied list of URLs. Returned metadatas are not guaranteed to be
in the same order as the request. 

The `batch` endpoint behaves identically to the `extract` endpoint in all ways except two:
1. The endpoint returns an array of the JSON payload described above
1. When individual items have errors, the request will still return with a 200 status code. Inspect the 
payload for individual items to determine the status of an individual item request.

| Param | Description | Required | 
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| urls | A JSON array of the urls to fetch | Y |

#### extract [GET, POST]
Fetch the metadata and text content for the specified URL. Returns JSON payload as decribed above.

If the server encounters an error fetching a requested URL, the status code for the request will be set to 422 (Unprocessable Entity). This may change.

The returned JSON payload will include a `StatusCode` field in all cases, along with an `Error` field when
there's an error fetching or parsing the requested content.

##### Params

| Param | Description | Required | 
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| url | The url to fetch. Should be url encoded. | Y |

##### Errors

| StatusCode | Description | 
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 415 | The requested resource was for a content type not supported by this service |
| 422 | The request could not be completed |
| 504 | The request for the target url timed out |

In all other cases, requests should return a 200 status code, and any errors received when fetching a resource
will be included in the returned JSON payload.

#### extract/headless [GET, POST]
Identical to the extract endpoint, but uses a headless browser to scrape content instead of a direct http client. This endpoint is likely to change, with its functionality folded into the `extract` endpoint using a
param.

#### feed [GET, POST]

Feed parses an RSS or Atom feed and returns the parsed results for each of the item links in the feed.

##### Params

| Param | Description | Required | 
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| url | The feed url to fetch. Should be url encoded. | Y |

##### Errors

| StatusCode | Description | 
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 422 | The url was not a valid feed |
| 504 | Request for the feed timed out |

#### Global Params 
These params work for any endpoint 
| Param | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| pp | 1 | Pretty print JSON output |


### Healthchecks 

`scrape` has two healthchecks:

#### /.well-known/health

This is a JSON endpoint that returns data on the application's state, including memory and
database runtime info.

#### /.well-known/heartbeat

This just returns a status `200` with the content `OK`

### Authorization

By default, `scrape` runs without any authorization, all endpoints are open. JWT based authentication is supported, via the `scrape-jwt-encode` tool and a `scrape-server` configuration option. Here's how to enable it:

#### Generate a Secret

(`./build` is the path for executables built locally with `make` update this path if your binaries are elsewhere)

Running `scrape-jwt-encode` with the `make-key` flag will generate a cryptographically random HS256 secret, and encode it to Base64.

```
scrape % ./build/scrape-jwt-encode -make-key
Be sure to save this key, as it can't be re-generated:
b4RThFbyMKfQE3+jAjJcR5rjVgVOeA2Ub9eethtX83M=
```

You will need this secret to generate tokens and to configure the server for authentication; you'll need to save it, but don't share it via non-secure means, etc.

If the key is in your environment as `SCRAPE_SIGNING_KEY` it'll be picked up by both the JWT encoding tool and the server.

#### Generate Tokens

Tokens are also generated using `scrape-jwt-encode`. Here's the output of `scrape-jwt-encode -h`: 

```
scrape % ./build/scrape-jwt-encode -h       

Generates JWT tokens for the scrape service. Also makes the signing key to use for the tokens.

Usage: 
-----
scrape-jwt-encode -sub subject [-signing-key key] [-exp expiration] [-aud audience]
scrape-jwt-encode -make-key

  -aud string
        Audience (recipient) for the key (default "moz")
  -exp value
        Expiration date for the key, in RFC3339 format. Default is 1 year from now. (default 2025-05-16T11:45:45.842362-04:00)
  -make-key
        Generate a new signing key
  -signing-key value
        HS256 key to sign the JWT token
        Environment: SCRAPE_SIGNING_KEY (default &[])
  -sub string
        Subject (holder name) for the key (required)
```

When generating a key, only a `subject` is required. Authorization doesn't actually check this value, but it's a good idea to use unique identifying values here, as this may get used in the future and may also get logged.

Here's the output from token generation, after putting the key from above into the environment. The claims are printed out for reference, but it's the token at the bottom that you want to share with API consumers.

```
scrape % export SCRAPE_SIGNING_KEY=b4RThFbyMKfQE3+jAjJcR5rjVgVOeA2Ub9eethtX83M=
scrape % ./build/scrape-jwt-encode -sub some_user

Claims:
------
{
  "iss": "scrape",
  "sub": "some_user",
  "aud": [
    "moz"
  ],
  "exp": 1747410570,
  "iat": 1715874570
}

Token:
-----
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzY3JhcGUiLCJzdWIiOiJzb21lX3VzZXIiLCJhdWQiOlsibW96Il0sImV4cCI6MTc0NzQxMDU3MCwiaWF0IjoxNzE1ODc0NTcwfQ.4AapsWfYAK78JhP9AyhupmZAHLeRDyIPlE8ODwwsVRg
```

### Using Tokens When Making API Requests

When authorization is enabled on the server, API requests must have an `Authorization` header that begins with the string `Bearer ` (with a space) followed by the token.

### Enabling Authorization In `scrape-server`

To enable authorization on the server either:

1. Start the server with the `SCRAPE_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable
2. Pass a `-signing-key [key]` argument to the server when starting up

When enabled, `scrape` will check the following qualities of the token, and reject API requests with a `401` unless there is a token passed in the `Authorization` header fulfilling the following criteria:

1. It's a valid JWT token
2. The token has been signed with the same signing key that the server is using
3. The token's issuer is `scrape`
4. The token is not expired

Healthcheck paths don't require authorization. The test console at the root url normally follows the server's authorization configuration, bit it can be configured to allow open access while endpoints require tokens via the `-public-home` flag. When this flag is enabled, the server delivers short-lived tokens to the web client when loading the page. As such, this setting is primarily intended for convenience in development environments.

## Database Options

`scrape` supports SQLite or MySQL for data storage. Your choice depends on your requirements and environment.

### SQLite

SQLite is the default storage engine for `scrape`. There's no need for setup and you can get running right away. The database will autocreate if it doesn't exist. 

SQLite is ideal when there's a 1:1 relationship between the service and its backing store, or if you're running the service on a workstation or a 'real' computer.

If you deploy the Docker container to a cloud provider like GCP or AWS there will usually be a few hundred MB of disk storage associated with the container. Storage requirements typically translate to
about 3000 url metadatas per 100MB. 

When your container shuts down, previously stored data will be lost. This may or may not be a problem, depending on your application. Disk space can be monitored with the healthcheck.

It is also possible to mount a block drive to a container for persistent storage independent of the 
container lifecycle.

To specify a non-default path to a SQLite database using the command line `-database` switch or the equivalent `SCRAPE_DB` environment variable, use the form `sqlite:/path/to.db`. The special form `sqlite::memory:` is supported for a transient, in-memory database.

### MySQL

MySQL will be a good choice for applications that run under higher volumes or where multiple
service instances want to share a storage backend.

Here are the configuration options for MySQL:

| Flag | Environment | Description | Example | 
| -------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| -database | SCRAPE_DB | mysql: + addr:port | `mysql:mysql.domain.co:3306` |
| -db-password | SCRAPE_DB_PASSWORD | Password | lkajd901e109i^jhj% |
| -db-user | SCRAPE_DB_USER | Username for mysql connections | `scrape_user` |

Create the MySQL database by running `scrape -migrate up` with the applicable values above. For
database creation a privileged user is required. The database will be provisioned with two
roles; `scrape_app` for app operations and a `scrape_admin` role with full privileges to the
schema. Assign these roles to users, and assign those users to the arguments above, as appropriate.

## Building and Developing

### Building 

Best to build with `make`. The Makefile has a help target, here is its output:

```
scrape % make help

Usage:
  make 
  build            build the binaries, to the build/ folder (default target)
  clean            clean the build directory
  docker-build     build a docker image on the current platform, for local use
  docker-push      push an amd64/arm64 docker to Docker Hub or to a registry specified by CONTAINER_REGISTRY
  docker-run       run the local docker image, binding to port 8080, or the env value of SCRAPE_PORT
  release-tag      create a release tag at the next patch version. Customize with TAG_MESSAGE and/or TAG_VERSION
  test             run the tests
  test-mysql       run the MySQL integration tests
  vet              fmt, vet, and staticcheck
  cognitive        run the cognitive complexity checker
  setup-githooks   setup the git hooks
  watch-server     Start a hot-update scrape-server (requires entr)
  help             show this help message
```

### Using the Docker
The `docker-build` target will build a docker on the current architecture. Run this image with
`docker-run` (or with the normal Docker cli or desktop tools) to bring up a local instance of the service for testing. You don't need any Go tooling installed to build and run with the Docker.

To push a image to a registry, use `docker-push`. This will build a multiplatform amd64/arm64 image
and deploy it upstream. This image is appropriate for cloud platform deployment. The registry username 
or organization should match the username or organization of the working repo, and you need the 
appropriate permissions. 

The docker builds with local sources so use caution when pushing to registries.

By default, the Docker will run using a sqlite database at `/scrape_data/scrape.db` on the container itself. This can be changed via the `SCRAPE_DB` environment variable. You can also
use a mount to mount this locally.

The `docker-run` make target will mount a local folder called `docker/data` and bind that to the container for file storage. If you want to use a file-based db you can use this directory, or update the `Makefile` to mount the desired local directory. 


## Roadmap
- Outbound request pacing
- Expose outbound request options (headers, etc)
- Client preference settings (e.g. use headless for specific domains)
- Authentication hooks
